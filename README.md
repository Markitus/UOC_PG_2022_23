This repo contains some challenges about Graphics Programming. Challenges are organized in folders and include the solutions. They are intended to be used as tutorials to learn graphics programming for videogames development.

Some of those challenges are based on raylib, a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming.
